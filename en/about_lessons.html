                <h2>Preserving a Living Tradition</h2>
                <p>Hello, I am Olga, a musician and teacher who created this website honoring the musical traditions of Greece. This platform offers a home for authentic Greek music, where sacred and folk traditions are taught side by side, just as they have coexisted for centuries.</p>
                
                <h3>My Story & Philosophy</h3>
                <p>My experience comes from formal study, years of hands-on practice, and a heartfelt passion for the culture. Born in Melbourne, Australia, and raised in Greece from age 8, I have witnessed the rich interweaving of cultures firsthand. 
                    This bicultural perspective brings special insight into the lives of Greeks abroad and a deep appreciation for music’s role in sustaining identity and community.</p>
                
                <p>With a Diploma in Byzantine Music and a Degree in Greek Traditional Singing, and plays guitar, piano, and Oud, my mission is to help students of all ages connect with the stories, emotions, and depth of this music.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Teaching Approach</h3>
                <p>Lessons here explore far more than songs. Every session uncovers the emotional and cultural layers within the music. 
                    Special attention is given to Greek pronunciation, history, and practical guidance for both Greeks abroad and anyone drawn to the beauty of the Greek language through song.</p>
                
                <p>Whether just beginning or seeking deeper mastery, this is a space to explore, connect, and experience the living tradition of Greek music.</p>
