                    <h2>Byzantine Music: A Living Greek Tradition</h2>
                    <p>Byzantine music is the ancient sacred chant of the Greek Orthodox Church. In simple terms, 
                        it's the one-voice (monophonic) liturgical music sung in Byzantine-era churches. It originated
                        in the Byzantine Empire and continues today wherever Orthodox Christians sing hymns in Greek. 
                        There were no modern instruments in the old churches, just a choir or cantor singing beautiful
                        melodies (often supported by a low drone called the ison).</p>
                    
                    <p>This music uses a special system of eight modes (called the oktoechos, roughly like musical scales
                        or "tone-colors"). <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/byzantine-chant-01508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO even recognized Byzantine chant in 2019</a> 
                        as a living cultural treasure of nearly 2,000 years. Byzantine chant may sound exotic, but it's very much alive today. You'll hear
                        it in monasteries and churches across Greece and the Orthodox world. It's passed on through oral tradition and its own notation 
                        system (neumes), so that modern chanters sing essentially the same melodies as their medieval counterparts.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">For example, hymns like "Christos Anesti" (Christ is Risen) or "Axion Estin"
                        use melodies rooted in this tradition.</p>

                    <h2>Foundation of Greek Folk Tradition</h2>
                    <p>One of the coolest facts is that Greek traditional music actually grew out of Byzantine chant.
                        Greek demotic music is rooted in this ecclesiastical tradition. Greek traditional music has evolved 
                        from the Byzantine music tradition. In everyday terms, many of the melodies and scales you hear in 
                        regional Greek songs are cousins of the old church modes.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">If you listen carefully, some folk tunes (from Crete, Epirus, Pontus, etc.) have a similar
                        "modal" feel or ornamentation as Byzantine hymns. This means that learning Byzantine music gives you insight
                        into the very roots of Greek musical culture. In fact, anyone who wants to explore Greek folk music deeply
                        will benefit from understanding Byzantine chant.</p>
