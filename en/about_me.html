                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Olga ‚Äî a music teacher and musician specializing in Byzantine and Greek traditional singing. I also play the guitar and Oud.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hold a Diploma in Byzantine Music and a Degree in Greek Traditional Singing. My expertise is grounded in formal academic study, 
                        years of hands-on music practice, and a heartfelt passion for the sacred and folk traditions at the core of Greek musical culture.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">My mission is to help students discover and connect with the stories, emotions, and excitement of this music, 
                        whether through ancient melodies, vibrant folk songs, or the unique sounds of traditional instruments.</p>

                    <h2>My Musical Journey</h2>
                    <p>My journey began at a focused music high school and deepened through experiences like traditional Greek dance, choir participation, 
                        and years of dedicated music study and playing. These experiences shaped me as a lifelong learner, a musician, and a dedicated teacher in living traditions.</p>
                                                   
                    <p class="journey-text">These formal studies, combined with years of practical experience, have given me a deep appreciation for both the sacred and folk traditions that form the backbone of Greek musical culture.</p>

                    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I teach adults of all ages and children, in both Greek and English, through personalized online lessons. 
                        My approach is supportive and rooted in tradition, and I genuinely enjoy connecting with each student‚Äôs individual story and musical journey.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lessons involve much more than learning songs‚Äîthey also include vocal technique and explore the emotional and cultural layers woven into every piece. I make a special effort to share the nuances of Greek pronunciation, offering practical guidance for Greeks abroad as well as for anyone drawn to the richness of the Greek language through music. My teaching system is shaped by 
                        experience and respect for each person‚Äôs background and goals, inviting every student to discover their own voice while experiencing the depth of Greek musical traditions.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">I see this music not just as art, but as a path to a more centered, soulful life ‚Äî a gift I'm honored to share with the next generation.</p>

                    <h2>My Approach</h2>
                    <p>Born in Melbourne, Australia and raised in Greece from age 8, I have experienced the rich interweaving of cultures firsthand. 
                        This bicultural background gives me special insight into the lives of Greeks abroad and a deep appreciation for music's role 
                        in sustaining identity and community. I am especially passionate about helping members of the Greek diaspora refine their skills 
                        while keeping close ties with their roots.</p>
                    
                    <p>Internationalism and bilingualism are central to my teaching‚ÄîI warmly welcome students from around the world who are drawn to Greek
                    music, whether for cultural enrichment, personal growth, or artistic performance. I believe Greek traditional music offers beauty, grounding, and inspiration‚Äîespecially for young people and those far from home.</p>
