                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Olga ‚Äî a music teacher specializing in Byzantine and Greek traditional singing, and I also play the guitar and Oud.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hold a Diploma in Byzantine Music and a Degree in Greek Traditional Singing. My expertise is grounded in formal academic study, 
                        years of hands-on music practice, and a heartfelt passion for the sacred and folk traditions at the core of Greek musical culture.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">My mission is to help students discover and connect with the stories, emotions, and excitement of this music, 
                        whether through ancient melodies, vibrant folk songs, or the unique sounds of traditional instruments.</p>

                    <h2>My Musical Journey</h2>
                    <p>My musical journey began at the **Experimental Music High School of Pallini**, but it wasn't until 2012, through traditional Greek dance, that I reconnected deeply with music. That experience led me to join traditional music choirs, dive into study once again, and follow a path that brought me to the heart of this living tradition.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hold a **Diploma in Byzantine Music** from the Music School of the Holy Metropolis of Mesogaia and Lavreotiki (Rafina branch), and a **Degree in Greek Traditional Singing** from the **Protoporia Conservatory**, where I studied under the guidance of renowned musician **Christos Tsiaboulis**.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">These formal studies, combined with years of practical experience, have given me a deep appreciation for both the sacred and folk traditions that form the backbone of Greek musical culture.</p>

                    <h2>My Teaching</h2>
                    <p>Today, I teach both adults and children, in **Greek and English**, through online private lessons. As a native Greek speaker with strong command of English, I am especially passionate about helping members of the Greek diaspora improve their vocal technique and pronunciation. At the same time, I warmly welcome students living in Greece who feel drawn to this music ‚Äî whether for cultural enrichment, performance, or personal growth.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm also deeply committed to teaching children. I believe that Greek traditional music offers beautiful imagery, grounding emotion, and a sense of inner balance that young people truly need in today's world.</p>
                    
                    <p class="journey-text">I see this music not just as art, but as a path to a more centered, soulful life ‚Äî a gift I'm honored to share with the next generation.</p>
