            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Olga — a music teacher specializing in Byzantine and Greek traditional singing.</p>
            
            <p>I was born in Melbourne, Australia, and moved to Greece with my family when I was 8 years old. Growing up between cultures gave me a deep emotional 
                connection to Greeks living abroad. I understand how meaningful music can be in maintaining our cultural roots and emotional identity — especially 
                for those far from their homeland.</p>

            <h2>My Musical Journey</h2>
            <p>My musical journey began at the <strong>Experimental Music High School of Pallini</strong>, but it wasn't until 2012, through traditional Greek dance, 
                that I reconnected deeply with music. That experience led me to join traditional music choirs, dive into study once again, and follow a path that 
                brought me to the heart of this living tradition.</p>
            
            <p>I hold a <strong>Diploma in Byzantine Music</strong> from the Music School of the Holy Metropolis of Mesogaia and Lavreotiki (Rafina branch), and 
                a <strong>Degree in Greek Traditional Singing</strong> from the <strong>Protoporia Conservatory</strong>, where I studied under the guidance of 
                renowned musician <strong>Christos Tsiaboulis</strong>.</p>

            <h2>My Teaching</h2>
            <p>Today, I teach both adults and children, in <strong>Greek and English</strong>, through online private lessons. As a native Greek speaker with strong 
                command of English, I am especially passionate about helping members of the Greek diaspora improve their vocal technique and pronunciation. At the 
                same time, I warmly welcome students living in Greece who feel drawn to this music — whether for cultural enrichment, performance, or personal growth.</p>
            
            <p>I'm also deeply committed to teaching children. I believe that Greek traditional music offers beautiful imagery, grounding emotion, and a sense of 
                inner balance that young people truly need in today's world. I see this music not just as art, but as a path to a more centered, soulful life.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>My teaching style is personal, respectful, and rooted in tradition. Whether you're just beginning or seeking to go deeper, I would be honoured to 
                walk with you on your musical journey.</p>
