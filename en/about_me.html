                    <h2>My Story & Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Olga — a music teacher and musician specializing in Byzantine and Greek traditional singing. I also play the guitar and Oud. 
                      I hold a Diploma in Byzantine Music and a Degree in Greek Traditional Singing, and my expertise is grounded in formal academic study, 
                      years of hands-on music practice, and a heartfelt passion for the sacred and folk traditions at the core of Greek musical culture.</p>
                    <p>Born in Melbourne, Australia and raised in Greece from age 8, I have experienced the rich interweaving of cultures firsthand. This 
                      bicultural background gives me special insight into the lives of Greeks abroad and a deep appreciation for music's role in sustaining 
                      identity and community. I am especially passionate about helping members of the Greek diaspora refine their skills while keeping close 
                      ties with their roots.</p>
                    <p>My mission is to help students of all ages discover and connect with the stories, emotions, and excitement of this music. Lessons involve 
                      much more than learning songs—they also include vocal technique and explore the emotional and cultural layers woven into every piece. I also 
                      make a special effort to share the nuances of Greek pronunciation, offering practical guidance for Greeks abroad as well as for anyone drawn
                    to the richness of the Greek language through music.</p>
                    <p>I teach adults of all ages and children, in both Greek and English, through personalized online lessons. I believe Greek traditional
                      music offers beauty, grounding, and inspiration—especially for young people and those far from home. Whether you're just beginning or
                      seeking to go deeper, I would be honored to walk with you on your musical journey.</p>
