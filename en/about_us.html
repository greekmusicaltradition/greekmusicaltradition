                <h2>Preserving a Living Tradition</h2>
                <p>Hello, I am Olga — the founder of Greek Musical Tradition. I established this platform with a clear vision: to create a home for authentic Greek music where the sacred and the folk traditions are taught side by side, just as they have coexisted for centuries.</p>
                
                <h3>My Story & Philosophy</h3>
                <p>My expertise is grounded in formal academic study, years of hands-on music practice, and a heartfelt passion for the culture. Born in Melbourne, Australia, and raised in Greece from age 8, I have experienced the rich interweaving of cultures firsthand. This bicultural background gives me special insight into the lives of Greeks abroad and a deep appreciation for music's role in sustaining identity and community.</p>
                
                <p>I hold a Diploma in Byzantine Music and a Degree in Greek Traditional Singing, and I also play the guitar and Oud. But beyond the credentials, my mission is to help students of all ages discover and connect with the stories, emotions, and excitement of this music.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Teaching Approach</h3>
                <p>Lessons here involve much more than just learning songs—they explore the emotional and cultural layers woven into every piece. I make a special effort to share the nuances of Greek pronunciation and history, offering practical guidance for Greeks abroad as well as for anyone drawn to the richness of the Greek language through music.</p>
                
                <p>Whether you're just beginning or seeking to go deeper, I would be honored to walk with you on your musical journey.</p>
